# HydroServer

HydroServer is a software cyberinfrastructure platform created to support collection, management, and sharing of time series of observations from hydrologic and environmental monitoring sites. Under development at the [Utah Water Research Laboratory](https://uwrl.usu.edu/) at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/), HydroServer is designed to be an open source platform that enables research groups, agencies, organizations, and practitioners to more easily collect and manage streaming observations from environmental sensors.
